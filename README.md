# 🏠 House Price Prediction Web App (AI/ML + Flask + Render Deployment)

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is an **end-to-end Machine Learning web application** that predicts **house prices** based on user input such as square footage and number of bedrooms.

It demonstrates the full workflow of an **AI/ML project** — from data preprocessing and model training to web integration and cloud deployment using **Flask** and **Render**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict house prices using input features (size, bedrooms)
- Build a simple, responsive web interface for predictions
- Deploy the trained model online for public access
